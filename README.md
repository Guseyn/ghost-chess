# ghost-chess
Variation of chess, in which you can put several pieces on the same square and any piece can go through pieces with the same color. 
For the sake of simplicity, all pieces on the square must be captured one it's occupied by opponent's piece. 

It’s just an idea. Don’t know when I am going to implement this.
